## Quick start

1.  Make sure that you have Node v8 or above installed.
2.  Clone this repo using `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate.git`
3.  Move to the appropriate directory: `cd react-boilerplate`.<br />
4.  Run `npm run setup` in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.<br />
    _We auto-detect `yarn` for installing packages by default, if you wish to force `npm` usage do: `USE_YARN=false npm run setup`_<br />
    _At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`._
5.  Run `npm run clean` to delete the example app.

Now you're ready to rumble!
